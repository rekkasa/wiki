## Download R source code

Download `R` source code from [https://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/](https://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/) and untar
it (you will need to replace X with the version of R being installed).

```bash

cd $HOME/src
wget https://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-X/R-X.X.X.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ./R.X.X.X.tar.gz

```

## Configuration

Once the source is downloaded, from within the extracted source directory, execute these commands:

```bash

sudo ./configure --prefix=/opt/R/X.X.X --enable-R-shlib
sudo make
sudo make install

```

## Point to new R version

After R has been built from source, you need to point the current `R` and `Rscript` commands to the new version. The best approach is to place those in a directory inside `$HOME/.local/bin`

```bash

ln -sf /opt/R/X.X.X/bin/R $HOME/.local/bin/R
ln -sf /opt/R/X.X.X/bin/Rscript $HOME/.local/bin/Rscript


```
